# TimesSeriesAnalytics

As a final assignment in my time series analysis course, I created a Shiny App 
to analyze the relevance of peach milkshakes based on Google search history over
the past 18 years. 

The features of the app include:
An interactive full times series plot to visualize the entire data set containing
the frequency of the words 'peach milkshake' searched together on Google from 
January 2004 to March 2022. 

Under the next tab, "Analyze Patterns", there are options to visualize the seasonality, 
autocorrelation, and multiplicative decomposition of the time series data.

The "Forecasting" tab then provides multiple options for predictive models to visualize
forecasts of Google searches for 'peach milkshake' anywhere from 1 to 10 years out. 
There are several methods for simple models, exponential smoothing models, and ARIMA 
models to choose from and visualize.
